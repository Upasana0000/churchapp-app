      <h3>Right to Life</h3>
      <p>
        The True worshippers believe in the sanctity of human life. Life starts at conception. Abortion is not permitted for any member.
        Procurement of abortion or aiding someone to abort a baby is a disciplinary issue.
      </p>

      <h3>Discrimination</h3>
      <p>
        The True worshippers believe in the equality of males and females before God. The two sexes were both created in the image of God.
        The True worshippers do not discriminate on the grounds of race, sex, color, ethnicity, economic, social, age, or disability.
        The True worshippers aspire to minister to the elderly, widows and widowers, orphans, the economically disadvantaged, and persons
        with disabilities of all age groups in the church.
      </p>

      <h3>Children</h3>
      <p>
        Recognizing that children are a gift from God, the True worshippers seek to bring them up in the fear and admonition of the Lord;
        and to help them grow in wisdom, stature, and favor with God and humanity. The True worshippers prohibit physical, emotional,
        psychological, and sexual abuse to the children, including child neglect. The True worshippers uphold children's right to
        education, health care, pastoral care, and social welfare.
      </p>

      <h3>Ministry to Children</h3>
      <p>
        The church shall teach children in their early ages to experience salvation. The True worshippers shall organize children's Sunday
        school, vacation Bible school, Bible clubs, and other relevant children's programs. Once a child is eleven years of age, they may
        enter the catechism class and shall be eligible for baptism at the age of twelve, provided they meet the requirements for church
        membership.
      </p>

      <h3>Dedication of Children</h3>
      <p>
        It is a requirement for all members of the church of the True worshippers to dedicate their children. The True worshippers do not
        perform infant baptism.
      </p>

      <h3>Youth</h3>
      <p>
        The True worshippers shall guard youth against harmful traditional and modern practices such as pornography, alcohol, drugs and
        substance abuse, pre-marital sex, and sinful music.
      </p>

      <h3>Family</h3>
      <p>
        The True worshippers recognize the family as a sacred institution ordained by God and the backbone of the church and society. The
        family reflects the triune image of God. The True worshippers recognize marriage between male and female, people of biologically
        opposite sexes only. Marriage is upheld as a lifelong and indissoluble union between man and woman. In case of marital
        difficulties, matters should be handled according to the guidelines Jesus gave in Matthew 19:9. Upon the death of one of the
        partners, the other partner is free to remarry according to the scriptures (1 Corinthians 7:39).
      </p>

      <h3>Polygamous Marriage</h3>
      <p>
        The church of the True worshippers does not approve of polygamous marriages (Matthew 19:4-6). However, those who got saved in
        polygamous status are accepted by the church, and their participation in church activities will be guided by specific conditions.
        Women in polygamous marriages may be baptized if they meet the membership requirements, whereas polygamous husbands who were saved
        in that status may be baptized but are not eligible for leadership positions (1 Timothy 3:12).
      </p>

      <h3>Christian Marriages</h3>
      <p>
        The church of the True worshippers does not recognize certain marriage arrangements as Christian, including cohabitation,
        same-sex marriages, and marriages with large age differences or those involving old people marrying young people. The True
        worshippers also discourage spouse inheritance.
      </p>

      <h3>Burial and Memorial Services</h3>
      <p>
        The church shall conduct funeral services for its members, either in the church or at the burial site.
      </p>
