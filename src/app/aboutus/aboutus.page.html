      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Anglicare NT is a faith-informed agency, proud of its traditions as an NGO (non-government organisation) and a long-term
        territory based community service organisation that continues to adapt and respond to the needs of our communities.

        Anglicare NT was formed by the Anglican Church in the Northern Territory in response to identified community social needs.
        From the beginning, services have embraced all Territorians; no one is denied the respect, justice, and community of our work.
        Similarly, our staff reflect the full diversity of our community.
